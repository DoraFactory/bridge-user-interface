        The Company Services may allow developers and users to donate and store locally on their own
        devices, tokens, cryptocurrencies and other crypto or blockchain-based digital assets

        investment purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Accounts and Wallets</h2>
      <p>
        You do not need an account to use the Website and Company Services; however, you do need a
        wallet hosted by one of the accepted wallet providers—ERC 20, Cosmos or Aptos (“Wallet”) to
        engage in Staking, Public Good Staking, or Token Migration.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2>Staking</h2>
      <p>
        You agree and understand that this Staking Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions
        set forth in your User Agreement(s), which also govern this Staking Agreement. In case of
        conflict, the User Agreement(s) shall control. You further agree and understand that the
        defined terms used in this Staking Agreement, if defined in your User Agreement(s), shall
        have the meanings set forth in your User Agreement(s). Your use of our Staking service must
        comply with your User Agreement(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree and understand that by accessing or using Staking following any change to this
        Staking Agreement, your access or use of Staking shall constitute your agreement to the
        amended Staking Agreement, and you agree to be legally bound by its terms and conditions as
        amended. You should, therefore, read this Staking Agreement from time to time. If you do not
        agree to be bound by this Staking Agreement, you should not access or use Staking.
      </p>

      <h2>Permission</h2>
      <p>
        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Staking Agreement, we hereby grant to
        you a non-assignable, non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free limited license to use our
        Staking service. You may not use the Staking service if (a) you are not at least 18 years
        old and do not have the legal capacity to enter into this Staking Agreement, (b) you are a
        person barred from using Staking under the applicable laws of the United States or other
        countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use Staking,
        and (c) you do not agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of this Staking
        Agreement in their entirety.
      </p>

      <h2>Availability</h2>
      <p>
        When you hold certain supported Digital Assets in your wallet you may be given the option to
        “stake” these assets in a proof of stake network via staking services provided by Dora
        Factory. Dora Factory Staking Services are not currently available to customers in sanction
        countries and certain other jurisdictions.
      </p>

      <h2>The Service; Rewards; Services Fee; Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        If you instruct Dora Factory to stake your assets, Dora Factory or a Staking Services
        Provider will facilitate the staking of those assets on your behalf by acting as a
        transaction validator on the applicable network for the supported Digital Asset you stake.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Dora Factory or the Staking Services Provider successfully validates a block of
        transactions in that supported Digital Asset, you will earn a reward granted by that
        supported Digital Asset’s network. The timing and amount of your reward will be determined
        by the protocols of the applicable network. Dora Factory does not determine the timing or
        amount of your reward. There may be a delay between when you choose to stake your supported
        Digital Asset and when you start owing rewards because each network protocol’s activation
        queue determines when rewards start accruing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dora Factory will distribute any earned rewards to you after receipt by Dora Factory, minus
        a Staking Services Fee of 5%–100% of the rewards determined by the protocol. Some of the
        Staking Services Fee is used to pay ‘gas’ fees, third party fees, and infrastructure costs
        associated with staking and the remainder is retained by Dora Factory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Digital Asset networks subject staked assets to “slashing” if the transaction validator
        representing those assets incorrectly validates a transaction. Dora Factory and/or the
        Staking Services Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any staked
        assets from slashing; however, in the event they are, unless otherwise provided in this
        Staking Agreement or your User Agreement, Dora Factory will promptly replace your assets at
        no additional cost. For the avoidance of doubt, Dora Factory will not replace assets subject
        to slashing as a result of network, network provider, or operator errors, or any other basis
        covered by this Staking Agreement or in the Disclaimer of Liability or Force Majeure
        sections of your User Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Digital Asset Networks may impose a waiting period while staking, during which your
        staked assets will be restricted from transfer or sale (“Unbonding Period”). If you instruct
        Dora Factory to unstake your assets, you will not have access to your assets until the
        expiration of any applicable Unbonding Period. Dora Factory may also impose an additional
        waiting period in order to facilitate transfer of your assets to your Dora Factory Account
        after the expiration of any applicable Unbonding Period. If rewards are collected on your
        staked assets during an Unbonding Period, Dora Factory will credit these rewards to your
        Dora Factory Account.
      </p>

      <h2>No Guarantee of Rewards</h2>
      <p>
        The staking rewards and reward rates vary by the networks. This rate is an estimate and may
        change over time. Dora Factory DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY STAKING REWARDS,
        INCLUDING THE STAKING REWARDS RATES.
      </p>

      <h2>Governance and Voting</h2>
      <p>
        For certain Digital Assets, the underlying protocols offer stakers the ability to vote on
        matters related to the governance of protocol-level issues. Dora Factory may or may not
        support voting for such assets, and may cease supporting voting at any time in its
        discretion. In certain cases, Dora Factory may vote on your behalf where Dora Factory or the
        applicable protocol does not support delegated voting. In such instances, Dora Factory will
        vote in favor of the decision that it believes supports the most use cases for Dora Factory
        users.
      </p>

      <h2>Suspension or Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You agree and understand that we may, in our sole discretion, change, suspend, discontinue,
        or terminate any aspect of our Staking service, or its availability to you, at any time and
        without notice.
      </p>

      <h2>Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        You represent and warrant that you have the requisite authority to enter into this Staking
        Agreement according to its terms, and its performance does not violate any laws,
        regulations, or agreements applicable to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>
          The Staking service is provided on an “as is” basis. You and your affiliates disclaim any
          and all express or implied warranties, including, any warranties of merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose or use, or of non-infringement or any other violation of
          any third party intellectual property rights. We and our affiliates do not guarantee or
          make any warranty concerning the accuracy or reliability of the staking service, and
          disclaim any and all liability (whether in tort or contract or otherwise) for any direct,
          indirect, incidental, special, or consequential loss or damage arising from any delay or
          loss of access to the staking service, or otherwise in connection with the Staking
          service, staking rewards, or staked digital assets.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>
          To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, and notwithstanding any of the
          foregoing, we will have no liability under this staking agreement. For the avoidance of
          doubt, the warranties and limitations of liability set forth in this section are in
          addition to, and not in place of, those set forth in the user agreement.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h2>Public Good Staking</h2>
      <p>
        Public Good Staking allows users to stake certain tokens to Dora Factory’s node validators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public Good Staking is conducted through staking tokens using a Wallet to interact with
        related smart contracts or allocate tokens through smart contracts. Each ecosystem will have
        minimum and maximum periods to the staking of tokens. Each ecosystem will also have
        requirements when users unstake tokens from our validators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dora Factory might from time to time, in its sole direction, decide to implement incentive
        programs for users to participate in Public Good Staking. Such incentive programs will be
        determined solely by Dora Factory, and be published on Dora Factory’s social media accounts
        or websites. Users might also receive governance credit for use in connection with voting
        relating to that ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>
          You accept and agree to be bound by this Agreement by acknowledging such acceptance during
          the registration process (if applicable) or by accessing and using the Website and Company
          Services. If you do not agree to abide by this Agreement, or to modifications that Company
          may make to this Agreement in the future, do not use or access or continue to use or
          access the Company Services or the Website.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h2>Token Migration</h2>
      <p>
        The Token Migration interface allows you to access a protocol that migrates your
        Ethereum-based ERC-20 DORA tokens to the Dora Vota network (i.e., a CosmosSDK appchain). You
        may be required to pay a “gas” fee associated with interacting with the Ethereum blockchain
        network, and you are solely responsible for these fees and costs. Once you initiate a
        migration, it cannot be modified, reversed, or otherwise altered, and the originating
        Ethereum-based ERC-20 DORA tokens will be unrecoverable. While migration will typically be
        completed within 48 hours, delays may occur due to network congestion.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Responsibility in Token Migration</h3>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for ensuring that you own and have access to the network
        addresses used in the Token Migration interface. We cannot and are unable to verify the
        ownership of your network addresses. You are also solely responsible for ensuring that your
        Ethereum Wallet is properly connected and that the Dora Vota network address you entered is
        correct and complete. Any errors in your network addresses, specifically your Dora Vota
        network address, whether due to human error, technical failure, or other causes, may result
        in irreversible loss of your Digital Assets. We are not liable for any damages you may
        suffer as a result of any incorrect or incomplete network address, or your loss of access to
        your Wallet or network address, including permanent loss of Digital Assets, failed
        transactions, or the inability to access your Digital Assets. You own and control the
        Digital Assets in your Wallet and network address, and are solely responsible for their
        security. We do not have control or custody over the content and Digital Assets in your
        Wallet or network address.
      </p>
      <h3>Smart Contract Risks</h3>
      <p>
        By using the Token Migration interface, you agree and understand that your use is at your
        own risk. You are interacting directly with smart contracts on the networks, which involves
        inherent risks, including, but not limited to, bugs, exploits, technical issues, errors, and
        other potential vulnerabilities, and we are not liable for any such risks. We do not execute
        any transactions on your behalf. Any transactions initiated by you on the smart contracts
        cannot be modified or reversed.
      </p>
      <h3>Availability</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Token Migration interface at any
        time without notice to you. We do not guarantee and warrant that the Token Migration
        interface will always be available to you. The Token Migration interface is not currently
        available to customers in sanction countries and certain other jurisdictions, specifically
        customers residing in Excluded Jurisdiction or who are Excluded Individuals.
      </p>
      <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
      <p>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>
          The Token Migration interface is a non-exclusive means to facilitate access to the
          relevant protocol and/or smart contracts, and is provided on an “as is” basis. We and our
          affiliates disclaim any and all express or implied warranties, including, any warranties
          of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or use, or of non-infringement or any
          other violation of any third party intellectual property rights. We and our affiliates do
          not guarantee or make any warranty concerning the accuracy or reliability of the Token
          Migration interface, and disclaim any and all liability (whether in tort or contract or
          otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential loss or damage
          arising from any delay or loss of access to the Token Migration interface, including the
          bridging smart contract or otherwise in connection with the Token Migration interface.

        known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in

      </p>
      <h3>With Company</h3>
      <p>
        All questions of law, rights, and remedies regarding any act, event or occurrence undertaken

      </p>
      <p>
        The Company wants to address your concerns without the need for a formal legal dispute.
        Before filing a claim against us you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by
        contacting us at{' '}
        <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>
          support@dorafactory.org
        </span>{' '}
        to notify us of the actual or potential Dispute. Similarly, we will undertake reasonable
        efforts to contact you to notify you of any actual or potential dispute to resolve any claim
        we may possess informally before taking any formal action. The party that provides the
        notice of the actual or potential Dispute (the “Notifying Party”) will include in that
        notice (a “Notice of Dispute”) the name of User, the Notifying Party’s contact information
        for any communications relating to such Dispute (including for the Notifying Party’s legal
        counsel if it is represented by counsel in connection with such Dispute), and sufficient
        details regarding such Dispute to enable the other party (the “Notified Party”) to
        understand the basis of and evaluate the concerns raised. If the Notified Party responds
        within ten (10) business days after receiving the Notice of Dispute that it is ready and
        willing to engage in good faith discussions in an effort to resolve the Dispute informally,
        then each party shall promptly participate in such discussions in good faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        If, notwithstanding the Notifying Party’s compliance with all of its obligations under the
        preceding paragraph, a Dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is
        sent (or if the Notified Party fails to respond to the Notice of Dispute within ten (10)
        business days), the Notifying Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding as described
        below. If either party purports to initiate arbitration without first providing a Notice of
        Dispute and otherwise complying with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph,
        then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will promptly
        dismiss the claim with prejudice and will award the other party all of its costs and
        expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection
        with such Dispute.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any Dispute that cannot be resolved per the above procedure shall be referred to and finally
        resolved by arbitration administered by the Cayman Islands International Arbitration Centre
        (“SIAC”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Cayman Islands International
        Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be
        incorporated by reference in this clause. Subject, however, to the right of Company, at the
        Company’s sole discretion, to bring an action to seek injunctive relief to enforce this
        Agreement or to stop or prevent an infringement of proprietary or other third party rights
        (or any similar cause of action) in any applicable court in any jurisdiction exists with
        regard to a user. The seat of the arbitration shall be Cayman Islands. The Tribunal shall
        consist of three (3) arbitrator(s). The language of the arbitration shall be English.

      <p>
        You and the Company agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual
        basis, and neither you nor Company may bring a claim as a part of a class, group,
        collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a “Collective
        Arbitration”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any
        Dispute against Company will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (a) two (2) or more
        similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more
        claimants; and (b) counsel for the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across
        the arbitrations. “Concurrently” for purposes of this provision means that both arbitrations
        are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.

          entitled to consolidate, join or coordinate disputes by or against other individuals or
          entities, or arbitrate or litigate any dispute in a representative capacity, including as
          a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. In
          connection with any dispute (as defined above), any and all such rights are hereby
          expressly and unconditionally waived.
