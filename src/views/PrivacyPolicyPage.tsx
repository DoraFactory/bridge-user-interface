      </p>
      <h2>How This Policy Applies</h2>
      <p>
        This Policy applies strictly to information collected through the Service. It does not apply
        to any other websites under the same domain as the Service, or third-party applications,
        services, or websites, even if you access them through the Service. This Policy does not
        apply to information provided to or collected by any third party. When this Policy does not
        apply, you should read the applicable privacy policy and related terms posted on the
        website, application, or other service you are using before providing any information.
      </p>
      <p>
        note that we may change this Policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to check
        this Policy each time you access the Service so that you are aware of such changes, as they
        are binding on you.
      </p>
      <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        When you access and use the Service, we or our service providers may collect the following
        personal information about you. Please note that the examples below are just personal
        information we may have concerning you, but not necessarily information we have received
        about you.
      </p>

          <li>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Transaction Information: </span>
            When you transact or interact with a blockchain, including the migration smart contract,
            your transaction, and certain data may be recorded on the blockchain and become publicly
            available for others to see, including us. This information generally cannot be deleted
            or restricted given the nature of blockchain technology, and it may affect your privacy
            rights, particularly the right to delete and restrict. When you interact with the Token
            Migration, certain interactions will cause data to be recorded on a blockchain, such as
            your public wallet or network address, which we may collect to provide our services to
            you. By transacting on a blockchain, you acknowledge that sharing your public wallet or
            network address is your decision. If you do not want your privacy rights to be affected,
            you should not interact with the blockchain or share your wallet or network address with
            us or anyone else, as the blockchain infrastructure may impact those rights.

      <p>
        We may store, process, and transfer your personal information on servers outside of the EU,

        transferred and processed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. By using the

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We will retain your personal information for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of
        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
        strive to use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal
        information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>Age Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age
        of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian
        to use the Service. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree

        or access the Service or provide any information about yourself to us for the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We may use the cookies below to help us provide the Service and obtain certain information
        by automated means. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that is stored on your
        browser or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies contain information that is
        transferred to your device’s local storage.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Strictly necessary cookies:</span> These cookies are

        <li>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Analytical or performance cookies:</span>These
          cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of visits and to see how users move
          around a website when they are using it. This helps to improve the way a website works,
          for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Functionality cookies:</span> These cookies are used

          third parties for this purpose.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The length of time a cookie remains on your browsing device depends on whether it is a
        "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you
        close your browser. Persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined
        duration. You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies (except strictly
        necessary cookies). The cookies we use with the Service are either set by us (first-party
        cookies) or by a third party at our request (third-party cookies). We do not control these
        third parties' cookies or how they may be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can prevent certain web-based cookies from being downloaded on your device by adjusting
        the settings in your web browser. Most web browsers will provide information on how to stop
        accepting new cookies, how to receive notifications when you get a new cookie, and how to
        disable existing cookies. However, please note that without cookies, you may not be able to
        fully utilize all the features of our online services.
